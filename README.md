# Human Benchmark

This website has 8 games where you can test various skills you have ranging from your reaction time to short term memory, you can save your results to compare yourself to friends or the entire world with the percentile stat on your profile. As someone who's pretty good at these games, <details><summary>(my stats)</summary>

i've had my fair share of fun playing them. I thought it would be interesting to put my programming skills to the test by recreating them. 

What started just as a fun exercise for myself soon turned into a challenge as my unhealthy obsession with finishing projects i have started took control over me and forced me to stay up until 2 am fixing errors before the day of my math quiz while suffering from a terrible sickness causing me to have constant coughing fits and headaches. 

(Note to any future employers that might be reading this: Do NOT expect me to jeopardize my own health and wellbeing for your demands just because I have history of doing that even for completely useless projects)

# DAY 1 [(Reaction Time Test)](https://github.com/EgeEken/Reaction)

At this point, i had no concept of "day one" since this is before i made this into a challenge for myself, i decided to make a reaction time test thinking it would be easy enough, and all things considered, it was, the only problem was that this required a lot of precision with your click and the classic time.sleep() function has a lot of issues that come with inputs, most importantly, it saves your input and plays it as soon as the sleep period is over, which meant that by clicking early, you could get basically 0 ms every single time, so i had to improvise and make something that drains a lot of memory and computing power in exchange for fixing this one issue. In hindsight there was probably a way to fix it properly but i was more concerned about getting it done before collapsing in my bed so i'll let it slide.

# DAY 2 [(Sequence Memory Test)](https://github.com/EgeEken/Sequence)

For this one, most of my effort went into the planning and design, the bugfixing and tweaking part was surprisingly easy afterwards since i made the base pretty solid. A lot of the code in this served as a baseline for the following three days so i guess you could count some of that planning as part of the other days as well.

# DAY 3 [(Aim Speed Test)](https://github.com/EgeEken/Aim)

This one was easier than the last, but at this point my sickness was getting really bad so it was a struggle nonetheless. Not a lot to note about this one besides that this is the point where i realised "Wow i made 3 of these in 3 days, how about that", still under the illusion that I was in charge and not my crippling obsessive tendencies.

# DAY 4 [(Visual Memory Test)](https://github.com/EgeEken/Visual)

This one was mostly straightforward thanks to the borrowed code from day 2, however, there was one small issue that took me about 3 hours of debugging, erasing and rewriting code, taking breaks due to crippling coughing fits and headache attacks until i eventually settled on a slight improvement and collapsed into my bed. This issue was that your inputs from the previous round would be saved, once again due to, i'm assuming, time.sleep(). While the problem i was attempting to fix is still not fully gone, i believe it is now small enough to not cause any issues in the gameplay of anyone on the off chance that someone actually plays these instead of just going on the human benchmark website.

# DAY 5 [(Chimp Test)](https://github.com/EgeEken/Chimp)

This one was probably the hardest one conceptually among all of the tests, however, i was feeling much better at this point, so the added boost of concentration from my head NOT feeling like its gonna crack at any moment allowed me to finish up the code fast enough, but as is tradition with these tests, one issue causing boxes to overlap took about an hour of debugging, replanning, rewriting and testing code to be fully fixed.
